# Atom config:
* sublime column selection (need to get link)
  * https://atom.io/packages/sublime-style-column-selection

# Atom goodies/cheatsheet:
* multiple selection - need to get a handle on that
* multi-cursor - similar and need to sort that out as well

The two above provide functionality that may provide similar or even better functionality than the sublime column selection extension
