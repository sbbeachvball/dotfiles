# dotfiles
A repo for my preferred unix environment.  I primarily use Mac and Linux (Fedora/CentOS).
My setup is not nearly as sophisticated as many of the other repos listed under Inspiration.

Eventually I may break down and fork one of those and start over, but for now this will do.

# Installation
Assumed that this repo will be cloned into a "dotfiles" folder. 

* clone repo into "dotfiles"
* cd dotfiles
* bin/install.sh

 The install.sh script takes precautions to preserve any existing files (backed up to a date/time stamped version)

## ToDo
Should probably add some provisions for 
figuring out what folder this actually lives in to be able to link everything correctly.
