# dotfiles
A repo for my preferred unix environment.  I primarily use Mac and Linux (Fedora/CentOS).
My setup is not nearly as sophisticated as many of the other repos listed under Inspiration.

Eventually I may break down and fork one of those and start over, but for now this will do.

# Inspiration 
My inspiration was derived from various others (just some to note are below)
